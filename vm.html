        <h2>What is a Virtual Machine?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, enabling multiple operating
        systems to run on a single physical machine. In this introduction, we'll explore how virtual machines work,
        their advantages, different types, key terms, and installation sources.

        <h3>How Virtual Machines Work</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
        Virtual machines operate by utilizing a hypervisor to manage and allocate resources, allowing multiple
        instances of operating systems to coexist on a single host machine. This isolation provides flexibility and
        efficient resource utilization.

        <h3>Advantages of Virtual Machines</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
        - Isolation and security<br>
        - Resource optimization<br>
        - Easy software testing and development<br>
        - Server consolidation and scalability
    </p>

        <h3>Types of Virtual Machines</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
        - Full Virtualization<br>
        - Para-Virtualization<br>
        - Hardware-Assisted Virtualization
    </p>

        <h3>Key Terms in Virtual Machines</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
        - Hypervisor:<br>
A hypervisor (also known as a virtual machine monitor, VMM, or virtualizer) is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Unlike an emulator, the guest executes most instructions on the native hardware.[1] Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-systemâ€“level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel.<br>

        - Host OS<br>

        <h3>Installation Sources</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
        Virtual machines can be installed from various sources, including software vendors, cloud providers, and open
        source projects.
