  <h1>Computers and Their Components</h1>

  <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data to perform various tasks. It consists of several components that work together to execute instructions and manipulate data.</p>
  <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

            <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
  <p>RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly.</p>

  <h2>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) / Solid State Drive (SSD)</h2>
  <p>HDD or SSD stores data permanently on the computer. HDDs use spinning disks, while SSDs use flash memory.</p>

  <h2>Motherboard</h2>
  <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board. It connects all the computer components together.</p>

  <h2>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
  <p>The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations.</p>

  <h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
  <p>The PSU provides electrical power to the computer.</p>

  <h2>Input and Output Devices</h2>
  <p>Devices like keyboard, mouse, monitor, and printer allow users to interact with the computer.</p>
